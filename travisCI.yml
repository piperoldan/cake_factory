language: python
python:
  - "3.12.0"  # Specify the Python version to use for the build

# This section is crucial for installing any dependencies your project needs.
# For Python, this typically involves installing packages listed in a requirements.txt file.
install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt

# Optional: Commands to run before the script step.
# For example, if you need to set up environment variables or a database.
# before_script:
#   - echo "Running pre-script commands..."

script:
  - python cake_factory_test.py  # Run the test suite for the cake factory application
# - pytest  # Uncomment if you want to use pytest for running tests
# Optional: Cache installed dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
# Travis CI will cache the directory specified, so if your dependencies are in a virtual environment
# or a specific package directory, you'd specify that here.
# For pip, it often caches in ~/.cache/pip
# cache: pip

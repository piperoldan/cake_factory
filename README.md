#Cake factory

This repository was build in order to learn CI/CD with travis-CI.com.

It has 4 files:
cake_factory.py written in python
cake_factory_tests.py with scripts that test the main file
travisCI.yml that is the file required by travis to work. Created with Gemini
and another file --pycache__ that I don't know where it came from or its function, 
but it was there and I added to git.

I'm waiting to get my account working with travisci to begin testing

Here are some comments from Gemini about this repo:

Given that you're just learning and haven't paid for a plan, it's important to note that Travis CI's free tier primarily supports public repositories on GitHub. If your cake_factory_test.py project is in a private GitHub repository, you might find limitations or need to upgrade your plan to run builds consistently. For public repositories, this setup should work fine.

Here are a few things you might consider adding or clarifying, especially for a real-world project, but also good for learning:

install step: Most Python projects have dependencies. You'll typically need to install them before running your tests.

before_script (Optional): Sometimes you need to run commands before the main script, like setting up a database or environment.

Caching (Optional but Recommended): For faster builds, you can cache dependencies.

Key additions and explanations:

install: I've added an install step with pip install -r requirements.txt. If your cake_factory_test.py relies on any external libraries (e.g., pytest, unittest, or any other third-party package), you would list them in a file named requirements.txt in the root of your repository. Travis CI will then automatically install them before running your tests. If your cake_factory_test.py only uses standard library modules, you might not strictly need this, but it's good practice.

cache (commented out): I've included a commented-out cache: pip line. If you have many dependencies, caching them can significantly reduce build times on subsequent runs, as Travis CI won't need to download and install them every time.

before_script (commented out): This is a placeholder for any commands you might need to run before your main test script, but after dependencies are installed.

For your initial learning, your current file is perfectly adequate. As you progress, you'll find the install and cache sections become very important for more complex projects.

#Cake factory

This repository was build in order to learn CI/CD with travis-CI.com.

It has 4 files:
cake_factory.py written in python
cake_factory_tests.py with scripts that test the main file
travisCI.yml that is the file required by travis to work
and another file --pycache__ that I don't know where it came from or its function, 
but it was there and I added to git.

I'm waiting to get my account working with travisci to begin testing
